# Session Note — nameLower Backfill Completion

- Date: 2025-09-11
- Scope: Phase 0 — Stabilize & Baseline (P2)

What was done

- Ran Admin → Maintenance → “Run full backfill…” dialog to execute the `backfillNameLower` callable in a loop until `nextStartAfter` returned null.
- Page size used: 500 (default from Admin dialog).

Result (emulator seed dataset)

- Members scanned: 66 (1 page)
- Members updated: 6 (added `nameLower` for initial 2 members, 1 admin, 3 agents)
- Pages processed: 1
- nextStartAfter: null (completed)
- Errors: none observed
- Skipped: none (beyond already-correct records)

Validation

- Confirmed all `members` documents now have `nameLower` populated and consistent with `name.toLowerCase().trim()`.
- Checked `admin_jobs` for `job=backfillNameLower`; latest record shows `nextStartAfter=null` and `updated=6`.

Notes

- Seeded bulk members (60) already included `nameLower`; the backfill covered early seed docs for 2 members, admin, and 3 agents.
- Callable details: `functions/src/lib/backfill.ts` paginates by `name`, updates only when `nameLower` differs, and logs each page to `admin_jobs`.
