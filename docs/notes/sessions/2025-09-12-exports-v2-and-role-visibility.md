# Session Notes — 2025-09-12

Summary

- Implemented Exports v2 (async CSV pipeline): callable `startMembersExport` + Firestore `onCreate` worker streaming to GCS with progress and a 3‑day signed URL.
- Built Admin Exports UI (builder with filters + columns, live progress, copy link / open in GCS).
- Added composite indexes to support admin member filters.
- Improved role visibility: show member `role` in Admin (Users table, search results) and on the Digital Membership Card.

Verification (emulators)

- Functions: `cd functions && npm run serve`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- Sign in as `admin@example.com` (password `password123`) → Admin → Exports → run an export with BASIC preset
- Observe `exports/{id}` doc updating progress; confirm signed URL appears on success and downloads

Notes

- Storage rules enforce admin‑only read for `/exports/**`.
- Concurrency guard: max 2 running exports per admin; UI shows an error if exceeded.
- Columns presets: BASIC and FULL; only allowed columns are emitted; `active` is computed.

Follow‑ups

- Review bucket lifecycle policy for `exports/members/*.csv` (auto‑delete after N days).
- Add cancel/suspend for running exports (optional, low priority).
- Expand tests for edge filters (date ranges) and large datasets.
