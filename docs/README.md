Documentation Index

- Backlog (single source of truth): docs/NEXT_TASKS.md

Conventions

- Keep NEXT_TASKS.md authoritative for what’s next; reflect session outcomes there.
- Runbooks are living docs; split by topic if they grow large and link from runbooks.md.
- Snapshots: keep only the latest 1–2 in docs/snapshots/; move older to docs/archive/snapshots/ if needed.
- Session Notes: short, date-stamped notes with outcomes and follow-ups. Link follow-ups in NEXT_TASKS.md.
